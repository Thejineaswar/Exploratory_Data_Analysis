I did this analysis to check the trend of the pandemic situation. This notebook is not yet completed, I have web scraped some data to compare the cases ratio to the population.
The data used for analysis is take from the Johns Hopkins CSSE data repository: [Click here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)

The file size of the notebook is greater than 25 MB, as a result the output had to be cleared. Please visit this link here to view the visualizations:
